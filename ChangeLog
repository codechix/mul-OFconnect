 mul 2.0 release notes 
-------------------------

Core infrastructure
-   Availability of "services" exported to various apps.
-   Support for RPC or shared memory constructs for inter-app communication 
-   Support for auxillary connections by "core" mul to boost parallel processing
-   Support for seqlock primitive for low contention locking
-   datapath-id abstraction into a sequential-id space for applications
-   Stringent flow and action validations before applying to hardware
-   Support for almost all OF 1.0 actions 

New applications
-   Fabric app :
    - Adds ability to form a data center fabric using a set of openflow 1.0 switches
        - Weaves point to point multiple-l2 networks 
        - Multi-tenant aware
        - Dynamic insertion and deletion of default gateways per tenant virtual network
        - Supports Openstack integration
        - Zero manual provisioning
        - Zero broadcast
        - Proactive flow installation with no controller software forwarding or latency for supported switches
        - Proxy ARP available for unsupported switches (which can't identify L3 fields in ARP packets)
        - Fast rerouting response to port down events i.e can fall back to secondary routes in sub-second time-periods
        - Support for online switch addition or deletion to fabric          
        - Support for v-motion

-   CLI app :
    - Unified cli for controller provisioning and debugging
        - Provides configurations backup mechanism in persistent storage
        - Supports config replay based on per application events
        - Extensions for future config HA 
        - NBAPI integration

New Services 
-   Routing and Topology
    - Shortest path computation using Floyd warshall algorithm
    - Service exported via shared-memory constructs
    - Scalable upto 512 switches. (This number is just a testing limit)
    - Topology discovery using LLDP protocol
    - Can identify fabric-ports from external ports
